## Projects
### Project 1: HR Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Damilare-s_portfolio/blob/main/images/HR%20analysis%20slides.pdf)

Gender equality, diversity, and demographics were understood and also the trend and pattern of the hiring process in the organization were well identified.

### Project 2: Sales Growth Through Sentiment Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Amazon_sentiment_new.ipynb)

The sentiments of the India Amazon customer reviews were gotten and machine learning models were built and optimized for better accuracy. EDA was performed which got different insights on the products and an evaluation method was used to get the performance of the models.
