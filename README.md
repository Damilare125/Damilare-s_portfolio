## Projects
### Project 1: Sales Growth Through Sentiment Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Amazon_sentiment_new.ipynb)
The sentiments of the India Amazon customer reviews were gotten and machine learning models were built and optimized for better accuracy. EDA was performed which got different insights on the products and an evaluation method was used to get the performance of the models.

### Project 2: Machine Learning and Optimization
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Machine%20learning%20and%20optimization.ipynb)

Developed 5 different machine learning and neural network models where the insight of the dataset was obtained, clustering and the correlation of the variables in the dataset were also observed, and then optimization was performed on the machine learning models.

### Project 3: Meal recommender system
[Publication](https://github.com/Mealygroup/data-science)

Developed a recommender system model using **Python**. The data used for this project was generated using **Python modules** and the model built recommends food for the app users. The model was deployed as an API using Flask API.

### Project 5: Salary prediction model
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Machine_learning_project_1.ipynb)

A predictive **Machine Learning** model was built using **Python pipeline** and **Python algorithms**. The model predicts employees earning more than 50,000 in a company.

### Project 6: Skincare Products EDA and Sentiment Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Sentiment_Analysis_For_Text_Data.ipynb)

Sentiment analysis was performed. A **Machine Learning** model was built to predict if a review is positive or negative. A **word cloud** was created showing the words/phrases commonly associated with each of the skincare products. Also, the insight of the skincare products dataset was well explored.

### Project 7: Data gathering
[Publication](https://github.com/Mealygroup/data-science/blob/main/Data%20Gathering.....ipynb)

Synthetic data was generated using the **python libraries**. The data was generated to build a recommender system model for an app and the purpose was well fulfilled.

### Project 8: IBM Employee Attribution
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/EDA-PROJECT/blob/main/IBM_Employee_Attribution.ipynb)

I analyzed and derived insight from attrition data. Exploration data analysis was performed, and the insight of the attrition dataset was well explored.
