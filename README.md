# Data Scientist

## Professional Summary
As a junior and passionate data scientist with over a year of experience, I have experience in developing and implementing recommender system models, and predictive models, conducting statistical analyses, and creating visualizations to communicate structured and unstructured data insight. I'm always open to new ideas and ways I can improve, and become more expert in this career.

## Work Experience
**Data Science Intern (_Remote_) @ Ignitus LMS (_August 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Worked on a project whose ultimate objective is to produce a marketable e-learning product.

**Data Science Intern (_Remote_) @ Stutern (_July 2023 - October 2023_)**
- Built a recommendation system model for a meal app.
- The model built was deployed using FLASKAPI.
- Built a salary prediction model.
- Did a sentiment analysis on a skincare product review.

## Projects
### Project 1: Machine Learning and Optimization

Developed 5 different machine learning and neural network models where the insight of the dataset was obtained, clustering and the correlation of the variables in the dataset were also observed then optimization was performed on the machine learning models.

### Project 2: Meal recommender system
[Publication](https://github.com/Mealygroup/data-science)

Developed a recommender system model using **Python**. The data used for this project was generated using **Python modules** and the model built recommends food for the app users. The model was deployed as an API using Flask API.

### Project 3: Precision Farming for Best Product Results
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Kluster)

A machine learning model was built to predict when a crop should be planted and harvested.

### Project 4: Salary prediction model
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Machine_learning_project_1.ipynb)

A predictive **Machine Learning** model was built using **Python pipeline** and **Python algorithms**. The model predicts employees earning more than 50,000 in a company.

### Project 5: Skincare Products EDA and Sentiment Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Sentiment_Analysis_For_Text_Data.ipynb)

Sentiment analysis was performed. A **Machine Learning** model was built to predict if a review is positive or negative. A **word cloud** was created showing the words/phrases commonly associated with each of the skincare products. Also, the insight of the skincare products dataset was well explored.

### Project 6: Data gathering
[Publication](https://github.com/Mealygroup/data-science/blob/main/Data%20Gathering.....ipynb)

Synthetic data was generated using the **python libraries**. The data was generated to build a recommender system model for an app and the purpose was well fulfilled.

### Project 7: IBM Employee Attribution
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/EDA-PROJECT/blob/main/IBM_Employee_Attribution.ipynb)

I analyzed and derived insight from attrition data. Exploration data analysis was performed, and the insight of the attrition dataset was well explored.
