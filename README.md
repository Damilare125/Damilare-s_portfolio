## Work Experience
**Data science intern @ Stutern (_Jan 2023 - Present_)**
- Built a recommendation system model for a meal app.
- The model built was deployed using FLASKAPI.
- Built a salary prediction model.
- Did a sentiment analysis on a skincare product review.

## Projects
### Meal recommender system
[Publication](https://github.com/Mealygroup/data-science)

Developed a recommender system model using **Python**. The data used for this project was generated using **Python modules** and the model built recommend food for the app users. The model was deployed as API using Flask Api.

### Salary prediction model
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Machine_learning_project_1.ipynb)

A predictive **Machine Learning** model was built using **Python pipeline** and **Python algorithms**. The model predicts employees earning more than 50,000 in a company.

### Skincare products EDA and Sentiment Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/Machine_learning_project/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Sentiment_Analysis_For_Text_Data.ipynb)

Sentiment analysis was perfomed. A **Machine Learning** model was built to predict if a review is positive or negative. A **wordcloud** was created showing the words/phrases commonly associated with each of the skincare products. Also the insight of the skincare products dataset was well explore.

### Data gathering
[Publication](https://github.com/Mealygroup/data-science/blob/main/Data%20Gathering.....ipynb)

Sythentic data was generated using the **python libraries**. The data was generated for the purpose of building a recommender system model for an app and the purpose was well fulfiled.

### IBM Employee Attribution
[Publication](https://github.com/Damilare125/EDA-PROJECT/blob/main/IBM_Employee_Attribution.ipynb)

Exploration data analysis was performed. The insight of the attrition dataset was well explore.
